# Brain-Drone Race Simulator

The Brain-Drone Race Simulator uses your brain waves to move a drone faster or slower depending on gamma and alpha bands. It uses [bci.js](https://bci.js.org/) and [BCIDevice](https://github.com/htil/BCIDevice) to process the raw EEG data coming from the [Muse](https://choosemuse.com/) device. Along with Unity and WebAssembly to power the simulator.
